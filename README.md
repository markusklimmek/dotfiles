## Prepare for strap
Create a file named ```github.credentials``` in the folder credentials, it should look like this. This folder will be created, but no file in here will ever be commited. Perfect for credentials (but I think there is a more elegant solution out there)

```
export STRAP_GITHUB_USER=<YourGitHubUserName>
export STRAP_GITHUB_TOKEN=<YourGithubToken>
```
